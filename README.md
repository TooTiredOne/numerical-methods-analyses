# numerical-methods-analyses
A software allowing to plot graphs of different numerical methods for solving differential equations.

To be more precise, for given y' = f(x,y), y0, x0, X, N the following charts are plotted:

* Euler's Method
* Improved Euler's Method
* Runge-Kutta's method
* Local errors on each x in [x0, X]
* Total approximation error for a given range of N


GUI is implemented using tkinter with MVC principle

matplotlib is used for plotting
